# CI/CD Version Compatibility Fix Applied
**Date**: 2025-07-21  
**Issue**: GitHub CI workflows using `version: latest` for golangci-lint
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Root Cause
The CI workflows were using `version: latest` for golangci-lint, which could pull incompatible versions with Go 1.22. This creates version drift and potential failures when the latest golangci-lint requires newer Go versions.

## Fix Applied

### Files Modified:
1. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**
   - Changed: `version: latest` → `version: v1.59.1`
   - Ensures compatibility with Go 1.22

2. **`.github/workflows/golangci-lint.yml`**
   - Changed: `version: latest` → `version: v1.59.1`
   - Maintains consistency across all workflows

## Verification
- ✅ Both workflows now use identical golangci-lint version
- ✅ Version v1.59.1 is confirmed compatible with Go 1.22
- ✅ Aligns with project's Go version strategy

## Expected Result
- Stable, predictable CI/CD behavior
- No version drift issues
- Consistent linting results across all environments

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push changes
2. Monitor GitHub Actions for green status
3. Document in project tracking files
