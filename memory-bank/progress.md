# Project Progress: SHIPS2-Go

## Current Status: Production Ready (Version 1.0+)

The project is considered feature-complete and stable for production use. The core requirements outlined in the project brief have been met.

## What Works
-   **End-to-End Password Rotation:** The client can successfully rotate its password and escrow it with the server.
-   **BitLocker Key Escrow:** The client can escrow the BitLocker recovery key.
-   **Secure Operator Access:** The SSH wrapper correctly handles `fetch` and `rotate` commands and denies all other actions.
-   **Authentication:** HTTP Basic Auth can be enabled and successfully protects the API endpoints.
-   **Auditing & Logging:** All critical actions are logged in structured JSON format.
-   **Wazuh Integration:** The system correctly forwards logs to rsyslog, and the provided Wazuh rules are functional.
-   **Deployment:** The `deploy_ships_server.sh` script successfully sets up the server environment.
-   **Build Process:** The `Makefile` can be used to build, test, and lint the project.

## What's Left to Build
As of version 1.0, there are no major outstanding features. Future work would likely fall into these categories:
-   **New Features:**
    -   Support for other operating systems (e.g., a Linux client).
    -   Integration with other secret management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
    -   A web-based UI for administration (though this would be a significant departure from the current SSH-only model).
-   **Improvements:**
    -   Enhanced test coverage.
    -   Performance optimizations for the server or client.
    -   Additional hardening of the SSH wrapper or API.

## Known Issues
-   There are no known critical bugs in the 1.0 release.
-   The dependency on a specific version of Go (1.22+) should be noted, as older versions may not compile the code correctly.
