# Active Context: SHIPS2-Go

## Current Focus
The current focus is on establishing the baseline documentation and understanding the existing codebase. This involves creating the initial Memory Bank files and preparing for any future development or maintenance tasks.

## Recent Changes
-   **Initialized Memory Bank:** Created the `memory-bank` directory and populated the core documentation files:
    -   `projectbrief.md`
    -   `productContext.md`
    -   `systemPatterns.md`
    -   `techContext.md`
-   **Codebase Review:** Performed an initial review of the `docs/project_overview.md` to gather the information needed for the Memory Bank.

## Next Steps
1.  **Create `progress.md`:** Document the current project status, including what is considered complete and what is still outstanding.
2.  **Full Codebase Scan:** Perform a more in-depth review of the entire codebase, including the `cmd`, `internal`, and `scripts` directories, to gain a deeper understanding of the implementation details.
3.  **Validate Build Process:** Run the `make all` command to ensure the development environment is correctly configured and the project builds successfully.
4.  **Await User Task:** Once the initial context is established, wait for the user to provide a specific development, maintenance, or troubleshooting task.
