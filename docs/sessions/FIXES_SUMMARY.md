---

## üìã Issues Resolved (7/7 Complete)

### ‚úÖ 1. API Response Inconsistencies - FIXED
**Problem**: Client expected `{password, rotated_at, actor}` but server returned `{hostname, password}`
**Solution**: 
- Created `PasswordInfo` and `BitLockerKeyInfo` structs with complete metadata
- Updated API handlers to return proper JSON structures matching client expectations
- Ensured all responses include timestamps and actor information

### ‚úÖ 2. JSON Field Mapping Issues - FIXED  
**Problem**: Client sent `{"host": ...}` but server expected `{"Hostname": ...}`
**Solution**:
- Added proper struct tags: `json:"host" binding:"required"`
- Created `RotateRequest` and `UpdateKeyRequest` structs with correct field mappings
- Standardized JSON field naming across all endpoints

### ‚úÖ 3. Missing Error Handling & Audit Logging - FIXED
**Problem**: No audit logging for reads, insufficient input validation, missing error context
**Solution**:
- Implemented comprehensive audit logging for ALL operations (read/write)
- Added `remote_addr` tracking for security compliance
- Enhanced input validation with `validateHostname()` and `validatePassword()` functions
- Improved error messages with proper HTTP status codes

### ‚úÖ 4. File Naming Inconsistency - FIXED
**Problem**: `makefile.txt` prevented standard make integration
**Solution**:
- Renamed to standard `Makefile`
- Enhanced with additional targets: `dev-setup`, `release`, proper versioning
- Added development tool installation automation

### ‚úÖ 5. Security Vulnerability (No Authentication) - FIXED
**Problem**: API had no authentication, anyone with localhost access could retrieve passwords
**Solution**:
- Implemented optional HTTP Basic Authentication (`SHIPS_AUTH_USER`/`SHIPS_AUTH_PASS`)
- Added timing attack protection using `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`
- Enhanced SSH wrapper with comprehensive input validation and command filtering
- Implemented proper security headers and middleware

### ‚úÖ 6. Database Schema Mismatch - FIXED
**Problem**: Documentation didn't match implementation, missing audit fields
**Solution**:
- Updated schema to include `actor` fields in passwords and bitlocker_keys tables
- Added `remote_addr` field to audit_logs for IP tracking
- Added `first_seen` timestamp to machines table
- Updated all documentation to match actual implementation

### ‚úÖ 7. Deployment Scripts with Placeholder URLs - FIXED
**Problem**: Scripts had hardcoded example.com URLs that wouldn't work
**Solution**:
- Complete rewrite of deployment scripts with proper error handling
- Added support for authentication configuration (`--auth user:pass`)
- Integrated Wazuh setup (`--with-wazuh`)  
- Added comprehensive validation and testing procedures
