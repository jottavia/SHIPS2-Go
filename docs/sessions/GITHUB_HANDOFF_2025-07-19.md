   ```

3. **Project Tracking Files**:
   ```bash
   # Already reviewed, ready to push:
   tracking/architecture.md
   tracking/decisions.md  
   tracking/next_steps.md
   tracking/project_status.md
   ```

4. **Additional Important Files**:

   ```

## Key Commands for Next Session

### 1. Check Current GitHub Status
```bash
# View what's already in GitHub:
github:get_file_contents owner=jottavia repo=SHIPS2-Go path=""
```

### 2. Push Remaining Critical Files
```bash
# Priority files to push first:
github:push_files with:
- RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md
- docs/client_task.xml
- docs/shipsc.1
- tracking/*.md files
- tests/integration_test.go
```

### 3. Update README.md
```bash
# Update README to point to correct GitHub repo URL
# Change references from placeholder URLs to:
# https://github.com/jottavia/SHIPS2-Go
```

### 4. Create Initial Release
```bash
# After all files are pushed, create v1.0.0 tag:
git tag v1.0.0
git push --tags
# This will trigger the GitHub Actions release workflow
```

## GitHub Repository Structure Status

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED DIRECTORIES:
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipelines
- `deploy/` - Deployment scripts and configurations  
- `docs/` - Core documentation (missing client_task.xml, shipsc.1)
- `installer/windows/` - Windows NSIS installer
- `scripts/` - Linux packaging scripts
- `bin/` - SSH wrapper script

### ‚è≥ PARTIALLY COMPLETE:
- `docs/` - Missing client_task.xml and shipsc.1
- `tracking/` - Files exist locally, need to be pushed
- `tests/` - Missing integration_test.go

### ‚ùå NOT YET PUSHED:
- Root-level status and documentation files
- Project tracking documentation
- Test files
- Setup and validation scripts

## Critical Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session - Priority 1):
1. **Push tracking documentation** - Essential for project continuity
2. **Push client_task.xml** - Required for Windows client deployment
3. **Push RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md** - Documents current production release
4. **Update README.md** - Fix GitHub URLs and deployment instructions

### Short Term (Priority 2):
1. **Push remaining utility scripts** - Setup, validation, testing
2. **Create v1.0.0 release tag** - Trigger automated build and release
3. **Test GitHub Actions workflows** - Verify CI/CD pipeline works
4. **Update deployment documentation** - Reflect actual GitHub URLs

### Validation Steps:
1. **Build Test**: Verify `make all` works after GitHub integration
2. **Deployment Test**: Test deployment scripts with GitHub URLs
3. **Release Test**: Verify automated release process works
4. **Documentation Test**: Verify all examples and links work

## Known Issues to Address

### 1. URL References
- Several files contain placeholder URLs that need to be updated to point to actual GitHub repo
- Deployment scripts reference `github.com/your-org/ships-go` (should be `github.com/jottavia/SHIPS2-Go`)

### 2. Release Workflow Dependencies
- Windows installer build requires binaries from GitHub Actions artifacts
- Linux packaging scripts expect specific binary names from build matrix
- Release notes path in workflows needs validation

### 3. Documentation Updates Needed
- README.md installation instructions need GitHub-specific URLs
- Deployment guides need to reference actual release download URLs
- API documentation examples should use production server addresses

## Success Criteria for Next Session

### Must Complete:
- [ ] All tracking documentation pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Client deployment files (XML, man page) available in repository
- [ ] Release notes and core documentation updated
- [ ] Repository has complete file structure matching local project

### Should Complete:
- [ ] Initial v1.0.0 tag created and release workflow tested
- [ ] All documentation URLs updated to reference actual GitHub repository
- [ ] README.md reflects actual deployment process

### Nice to Have:
- [ ] All utility and setup scripts available in repository
- [ ] GitHub repository description and topics configured
- [ ] Initial GitHub Issues created for known enhancement requests

## Repository Health Check

### Current State:
- **Core Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ Complete (CI/CD, deployment, packaging)
- **Documentation**: üü° 85% complete (missing task XML, man page)
- **Project Management**: üü° Local files ready, need to be pushed
- **Release Readiness**: üü° Ready for tagging once documentation complete

### Blocking Issues:
- None identified - all critical components are functional
- Missing files are documentation/convenience items, not blockers

### Risk Assessment:
- **Low Risk**: Core functionality and automation are complete
- **Medium Risk**: Documentation gaps could cause deployment confusion
- **Mitigation**: Priority focus on completing documentation first
