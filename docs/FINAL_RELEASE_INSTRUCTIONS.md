# üöÄ SHIPS2-Go v1.0.0 - Final Release Instructions

## ‚úÖ STATUS: GitHub Repository Complete and Ready for Release

**Repository**: https://github.com/jottavia/SHIPS2-Go  
**Status**: Production Ready - All files pushed  
**GitHub Issue**: https://github.com/jottavia/SHIPS2-Go/issues/1  
**Ready for**: v1.0.0 tag creation to trigger automated builds

---

## üìã FINAL STEPS TO TRIGGER GITHUB ACTIONS

Since I cannot directly create Git tags through the GitHub API, you need to run these commands to create the v1.0.0 tag and trigger the automated build process:

### Option 1: Using Local Git (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "C:\GPT Programing\SHIPS2-Go"

# Ensure you're on the main branch and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create the v1.0.0 annotated tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "SHIPS2-Go v1.0.0 - Production Ready Release"

# Push the tag to GitHub (this triggers the release workflow)
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Option 2: Direct GitHub Tag Creation
1. Go to: https://github.com/jottavia/SHIPS2-Go/releases
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Choose "Create new tag" and enter: `v1.0.0`
4. Target: `main` branch
5. Release title: `SHIPS2-Go v1.0.0 - Production Ready`
6. Description: Copy the content from `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md`
7. Click "Publish release"

## üîÑ WHAT WILL HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY

When you create the v1.0.0 tag, GitHub Actions will automatically:

### 1. CI Workflow Triggers (`ci.yml`)
- ‚úÖ Multi-platform testing (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- ‚úÖ Go linting with golangci-lint
- ‚úÖ Security scanning with gosec
- ‚úÖ Code coverage reporting
- ‚úÖ Cross-compilation validation

### 2. Build & Release Workflow Triggers (`build-and-release.yml`)
- ‚úÖ Build binaries for all platforms:
  - Linux (amd64, arm64)
  - Windows (amd64, arm64)
  - macOS (amd64, arm64)
- ‚úÖ Create Windows installer (`.exe`)
- ‚úÖ Generate Linux packages (`.deb`, `.rpm`)
- ‚úÖ Upload all artifacts to GitHub Releases
- ‚úÖ Generate SHA256 checksums

### 3. Release Artifacts Generated
The automated build will create:
- `ships-server-linux-amd64` - Linux server binary
- `ships-server-linux-arm64` - ARM64 server binary
- `shipsc-windows-amd64.exe` - Windows client binary
- `shipsc-linux-amd64` - Linux client binary
- `SHIPS2-Go-v1.0.0-installer.exe` - Windows installer
- `ships2-go_1.0.0_amd64.deb` - Debian package
- `ships2-go-1.0.0-1.x86_64.rpm` - RPM package
- `ships2-go-v1.0.0-source.tar.gz` - Source archive
- `SHA256SUMS` - Checksum verification file

## üîç MONITORING THE RELEASE

### After Creating the Tag:

1. **Check GitHub Actions Progress**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/jottavia/SHIPS2-Go/actions
   - You should see two workflows running:
     - "CI" workflow (testing and validation)
     - "Build and Release" workflow (artifact generation)

2. **Monitor Build Status**:
   - Both workflows should complete successfully
   - Build times: ~5-15 minutes depending on GitHub runner availability
   - Any failures will be clearly visible in the Actions tab

3. **Verify Release Creation**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/jottavia/SHIPS2-Go/releases
   - The v1.0.0 release should appear with all artifacts attached
   - Download and test the binaries to verify they work

4. **Validate Artifacts**:
   - Download the appropriate binary for your platform
   - Test basic functionality (version check, help command)
   - Verify checksums match the SHA256SUMS file

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Your release is successful when:
- [ ] ‚úÖ v1.0.0 tag created without errors
- [ ] ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflows triggered and completed
- [ ] ‚úÖ All platform builds completed successfully
- [ ] ‚úÖ Release artifacts uploaded to GitHub Releases
- [ ] ‚úÖ Binaries work correctly on target platforms
- [ ] ‚úÖ No build failures or errors in workflows

---

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### If GitHub Actions Fail:
1. **Check the workflow logs** in the Actions tab
2. **Common issues**:
   - Go module dependencies (run `go mod tidy` locally first)
   - File permissions on shell scripts
   - YAML syntax errors in workflows

### If Builds Succeed but Artifacts are Missing:
1. **Check workflow permissions** in repository settings
2. **Verify artifact upload step** completed in build logs
3. **Confirm release was created** in Releases tab

### If You Need to Re-run the Release:
1. **Delete the tag**: `git tag -d v1.0.0 && git push --delete origin v1.0.0`
2. **Fix any issues** in the code
3. **Create the tag again** with the same commands
